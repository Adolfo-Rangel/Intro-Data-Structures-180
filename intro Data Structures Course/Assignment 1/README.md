# Assignment 1: Intro to Data Structures and OOP

## **Overview**
This project is part of an **Intro to Data Structures and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** course. It demonstrates the use of sorting, searching, and data analysis algorithms in Java, integrated with OOP principles. The program allows users to input an array of integers, process the data using various algorithms, and analyze the results.

## **Features**
1. **User Input**:
   - Accepts 5 integers from the user via console input.

2. **Sorting Algorithms**:
   - **QuickSort (Ascending Order)**: Sorts the array in increasing order.
   - **QuickSort (Descending Order)**: Sorts the array in decreasing order.
   - **Bubble Sort**: Re-sorts the array for comparison with QuickSort.

3. **Data Analysis**:
   - Finds the **minimum** and **maximum** values in the array.
   - Calculates the **average** of the integers.

4. **Binary Search**:
   - Searches for a specific number entered by the user in the sorted array.

5. **Object-Oriented Design**:
   - Encapsulates operations such as sorting, searching, and analysis in the `database` and `Utility` classes.
