# Assignment 5: Palindrome Checker with Stack

## **Overview**
This project is a Java application that checks whether a given string is a **palindrome** using a **stack**. It demonstrates the use of **data structures** and basic **string manipulation** in Java. User input and results are handled through a graphical user interface (GUI) using `JOptionPane`.

## **Features**
1. **Palindrome Checker**:
   - Checks if a given string is a palindrome by reversing it using a stack and comparing it with the original string.

2. **Stack Implementation**:
   - Uses a `Stack` data structure to reverse the input string.

3. **Interactive GUI**:
   - Prompts the user for input and displays the result using `JOptionPane` for a user-friendly experience.

4. **String Comparison**:
   - Compares the original string with its reversed version to determine if it's a palindrome.

---

## **How It Works**
1. The user is prompted to enter a string via `JOptionPane`.
2. The program:
   - Pushes each character of the string onto a stack.
   - Pops characters off the stack to reverse the string.
3. The reversed string is compared to the original string.
4. A message is displayed indicating whether the string is a palindrome.
