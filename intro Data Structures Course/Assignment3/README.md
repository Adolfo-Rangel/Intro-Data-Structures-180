# Assignment 3: Intro to Data Structures and OOP

## **Overview**
This project is part of an **Intro to Data Structures and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** course. It demonstrates the use of sorting and searching algorithms while applying OOP principles in Java. The program accepts user input, processes data, and performs operations such as sorting, finding min/max values, and searching for specific elements.

## **Features**
1. **User Input**:
   - Accepts 5 integers from the user and stores them in an array.

2. **Sorting Algorithms**:
   - **QuickSort**: Efficiently sorts the array in ascending order.
   - **Bubble Sort**: Re-sorts the array using a simpler algorithm for comparison.

3. **Data Analysis**:
   - Finds the **minimum** and **maximum** values in the array.
   - Calculates the **average** of the integers.

4. **Binary Search**:
   - Searches for a user-specified number in the sorted array and returns its index.

5. **Object-Oriented Design**:
   - Encapsulates data manipulation in a custom `database` class.
   - Sorting logic is also provided through a `Utility` class.

## **Code Workflow**
1. **Input Collection**:
   - Prompts the user to input 5 integers.

2. **QuickSort**:
   - Sorts the integers using QuickSort and prints the sorted array.

3. **Data Analysis**:
   - Finds and displays:
     - Minimum and maximum values.
     - The average of the integers.

4. **Bubble Sort**:
   - Re-sorts the array using Bubble Sort and displays the result.

5. **Binary Search**:
   - Prompts the user to enter a number to search for.
   - Performs binary search on the sorted array and prints the result.
